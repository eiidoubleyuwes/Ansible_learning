# Ansible_learning
Playbook (YAML) files that I am learning to manage linux servers on AWS
This is part of my effort to become a devops assasin

To run a playbook,you have to make sure your host list exixts ie my host list is called centos

to run it paste the command : ansible-playbook <nameofplaybook.yml>
